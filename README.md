# twitter_api
Udacity Twitter Api project - from the We Rate Dogs Twitter account. Data is gathered, cleaned, wrangled and explored.
3 datasets are gathered, converted and pulled in to be assessed visually and programatically. 

Through assessment a list of quality and structural issues are identified ready for cleaning. After the cleaning process several insights are pulled from the data regarding tweet relationships with other variables. The main insights are:
1) The dog stage of the most retweeted tweet 
2) The number of retweets for the highest rated dog 
3) The dog with the least 'favorited' tweet 

The exploration also includes a visulaisation of tweets over time.
